# Thinky Nature

Welcome to my rice dotfiles of my ThinkPad X230

You surely will need to change some configs to fit your files and stuff and maybe tweak the icons on polybar so be ready to do that. 

Most of the other things should be self explanatory. Screenshot may have slightly other colors than the screenshot ^^
